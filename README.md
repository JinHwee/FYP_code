# FYP_code

# To-do
1. Incremental approach to update matrix when new node is added, instead of re-calculating the entire matrix improve time efficiency of the code during execution
2. Path dictionary: (i, j): (path from i to j)
3. Combine path dictionary into adjacency matrix
4. Compare path of same cost same length to determine which paths have more relevant nodes

# Notes
1. Incremental algorithm successfully passed custom test cases, pending new testcases for verification.
