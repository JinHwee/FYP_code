# FYP_code

# To-do
1. Incremental approach to update matrix when new node is added, instead of re-calculating the entire matrix improve time efficiency of the code during execution
3. Path dictionary: (i, j): (path from i to j)
4. Combine path dictionary into adjacency matrix

# Notes
1. Partial completion for incremental approach, reason being: new node added correctly, but all adjacency matrix is not updated with new path costs
